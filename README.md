Note
-----
This script was developed in order to cover personal needs and it is by no mean
guaranteed to work properly on every system.

Execution
-----
There are two ways that you can execute this script.

 * __1st way__:
```Shell
sudo ./installOracleJDK
```
In order to use this way, you have to download the '_.tar.gz_' file of
your choice from _oracle.com_ and save it inside the __Downloads__ directory of
your account. After download is complete, run the above command. During execution
you will be asked to enter your _username_ (username@host), in order for the
script to enter /home/_username_/Downloads/ and search for the file to be installed.

 * __2nd way__:
```Shell
sudo ./installOracleJDK <absolute-path-of-directory>
```
This way allows you to provide the __absolute__ path of the directory containing
the '_.tar.gz_' file as a command line argument, in order to override the default
option. __NOTE that the absolute path should end with a forward slash__ ( __/__ ).
<br><br>

Command example:
```Shell
sudo ./installEOracleJDK /home/gzachos/Desktop/
```

<br>
In case more than one '_.tar.gz_' files exist inside the specified directory,
you will be prompted just like it is shown in the screenshot below, to choose
the one you want to be installed.<br><br>
